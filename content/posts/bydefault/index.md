### Private and Secure by Default

Privacy and security are not something the general public regularly thinks or cares about. Because of this, the digital items and services we use need to be private and secure by *default*. However, the average person does not care or might not be aware that the item or service they use needs to be configured differently in order to to make them private and secure.

An example of this is Telegram, which does not have end-to-end encryption enabled by default. Instead it must be enabled in settings. Unfortunately Telegram is often touted as "a secure messenger", but due to end-to-end encryption not being enabled by default, most people who use it have only a placebo security. 

This is why choosing apps and services that are private and secure by default is critical. Those recommending products and services should recommend ones that adhere to this, and those designing the programs and services should create them to be private and secure, by default.
